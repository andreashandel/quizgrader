# Main importance


* Add code that creates subfolders in studentsubmissions for each quiz. Should either happen when grade tracking list is created or during deployment package. 
  + Subfolders are created when grade tracking list is created. Also, submissions are placed into quizid subfolder when submitted. **Need to make sure this doesn't overwrite files once class is in session.**

* Get grading app to work using the self-hosted shiny server setup.

* Keep updating vignettes.

* Figure out and implement setup for quiz/course maintenance while course is running.

* Get quiz analysis functionality to work.


# Medium importance

Get quiz deletion to work in quizmanager.


# Minor priority

Allow adding multiple quizzes at a time through quizmanager shiny app

Need to harmonize quizgrader and the solution files from DSAIDE and DSAIRM
