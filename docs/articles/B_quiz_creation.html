<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This document describes the steps required to set up a course and
create quizzes using <strong>quizgrader</strong>.</p>
<p>I assume you read the <a href="./A_introduction.html">introduction
vignette</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#getting-started"></a>
</h2>
<p>Start by loading the package with <code><a href="https://andreashandel.github.io/quizgrader/" class="external-link">library(quizgrader)</a></code>.
You can do most tasks related to quiz management through a user
interface (UI). If you want to use the UI, start the main menu with
<code><a href="../reference/quizmanager.html">quizmanager()</a></code>. This is the interface you will use to make,
manage and analyze the quizzes.</p>
<p>You can alternatively skip the UI and do everything on the command
line and by directly interacting with folders and files. The following
documentation explains both ways, always starting with the UI approach,
then explaining the equivalent direct approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="setting-up-a-new-course">Setting up a new course<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-new-course"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the UI, specify a name for the course, choose a directory in which
you want to place all the folders and files for the new course, and
click on <code>Start new course</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, from the command line you can start a new course
with</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/create_course.html">create_course</a></span><span class="op">(</span>coursename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"yourcoursename"</span>, courselocation <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"path/to/location/for/course"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You are required to provide a name for your course (which will be the
name of the main course directory). It is recommended you provide a
location where you want the course folder and its subfolders to go. If
you do not provide that, it will be created in the current working
directory.</p>
<p>If things go wrong, you should get an error message. Otherwise, there
should be a new folder with the course name you specified in the
location you chose. You will also get a message telling you where the
new folder has been created. Inside that main course folder are several
other folders and files, namely:</p>
<p><strong>Folders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>/studentlists</code> - a folder that will contains Excel
spreadsheet(s) with student roster information.</li>
<li>
<code>/gradelists</code> - a folder that will contain the main Excel
grade tracking spreadsheets, created by combining the student list and
quiz information (see below for details).</li>
<li>
<code>/completequizzes</code> - a folder which will contain Excel
files of all your quizzes (with answers) once you made them.</li>
<li>
<code>/studentquizzes</code> - a folder that will contain Excel
files with versions of the quizzes to be given to the students for
filling out and submitting. These files are generated once you made your
solution sheets.</li>
<li>
<code>/studentsubmissions</code> - all individual submissions by
students. Once the grading app is deployed and students start
submitting, their grades will be recorded in the main
<code>gradelist.csv</code> file. For record keeping and detailed
analysis, each individual submission is also kept. For easier
organization, a sub-folder for each quiz will be created and student
submissions organized into those sub-folders.</li>
<li>
<code>/templates</code> - a folder containing templates for quizzes
and student list. Use those as starting points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>studentlist_template.xlsx</code> is a template file inside the
<code>/templates</code> folder that should be populated with student
information, as described below.</li>
<li>
<code>quiz_template.xlsx</code> is a template file for quizzes,
generated inside the <code>/templates</code> folder. This file should be
used as template for creating your own quizzes, as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that if you retrieve template files through the UI, they
will come from inside the package, not your <code>/templates</code>
folder. This way, if you accidentally mess up the files in the
<code>/templates</code> folder, you can get clean versions
again.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="loading-an-existing-course">Loading an existing course<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#loading-an-existing-course"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the UI, you can load a course you created previously, so you can
continue working on it. If you are not going through the UI, you will be
directly copying files into the course folders. You therefore do not
need to set a course folder (but you’ll have to specify the folder when
you call the functions).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="add-students-to-the-course">Add students to the course<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#add-students-to-the-course"></a>
</h2>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="filling-the-template">Filling the template<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#filling-the-template"></a>
</h3>
<p>Once you created the course as described above, you need to add
students to the course. To that end, you need to fill out the provided
template with student information. Get the
<code>studentlist_template.xlsx</code> file either through the UI or you
can find it in the <code>/templates</code> folder on your computer
inside the course folder you just created. The template file has several
columns that you need to fill:</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="lastnamefirstname">Lastname/Firstname<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lastnamefirstname"></a>
</h4>
<p><code>Lastname</code> and <code>Firstname</code> columns should be
self-explanatory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="studentid">StudentID<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#studentid"></a>
</h4>
<p><code>StudentID</code> needs to be a unique identifier for each
student. Students will enter this when they upload their quizzes for
grading, and ut will be checked/matched to identify the student.
Matching is not done on names since those can be non-unique. The best
option is probably to use student emails as ID, but any other unique
identifier works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="password">Password<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#password"></a>
</h4>
<p>The <code>Password</code> column is there to prevent a student from
accidentally or purposefully submitting as another student. Of course,
this requires students to keep their passwords to themselves. This does
not prevent cheating. If students want to, they can share passwords and
submit for each other. Or they can share their filled out quiz sheets
before submission. I expect students to follow the academic honesty
policy, I use lots of low-stake quizzes that count for little of the
total grade (a single quiz usually &lt;1% of the total grade) and most
of my teaching is at the graduate level and students take my courses
because they are interested in the topic. All of these features minimize
the risk of cheating to a level that I don’t worry about it. <strong>If
you are worried about cheating on these quizzes, this package/setup is
likely not suitable for your situation!</strong></p>
<p>I collect passwords at the beginning of the course through a simple
Google form. I suggest you tell students to only use letters and numbers
in their password and nothing else (including no blank spaces). Other
characters might work, but in my experience this can lead to occasional
problems. I copy the passwords from the Google form/sheet into the
template. If you want to, you can likely automate this process with some
R scripts. (Or you can contribute this feature to the package,
pull-requests with new features are very welcome!).</p>
<p>Disabling the password feature is currently not possible. If you
think a setup without a password is a feature I should implement, let me
know. For the time being, if you don’t want to use this feature, just
enter the same password for every student and tell the students what the
password is. They’ll still have to enter it during submission, but that
should not be much of a nuisance.</p>
<p><strong>You should tell students that you will be able to read their
passwords and that this setup is not very secure, thus they should use a
<em>throw-away</em> password for this course and not any passwords they
use to protect real systems (e.g. their bank accounts)!</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="adding-the-filled-template">Adding the filled template<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adding-the-filled-template"></a>
</h3>
<p>Once you are done filling the student list, add it to the course by
clicking the <code>Add studentlist</code> button in the UI or manually
place it into the <code>studentlists</code> folder. <strong>Each student
needs to have a <code>StudentID</code> and <code>Password</code>
entry.</strong> Name information is recommended but optional.</p>
<p>During this process, all entries are converted to lowercase and any
leading or trailing blank spaces stripped. This is also done to the
information students provide when uploading their submissions, thus
hopefully minimizing mismatches for silly reasons.</p>
<p><strong>The only time the <code>studentlist</code> file is checked to
ensure it follows the required format is during generation of the
servery deploy package.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to keep track of changes, give the file a new name
(e.g. <code>studentlist_new.xlsx</code>). Any pre-existing file with the
same name will be overwritten. You can also manually copy the file into
this folder. I recommend only using letters, numbers and underscore for
file names. Other names might work, but since the files are deployed to
a server (which is likely running Unix/Linux), having file names that
contain other characters (e.g. dashes or blank) might cause problems.
You can have as many versions of the student list file in the
<code>/studentlists</code> folder as you like. <strong>When you generate
the grade tracking sheet (see below), the most recently modified
<code>.xlsx</code> file in this folder will be used.</strong> All other
files will be ignored. Make sure this file is a valid student list.
Ideally, at this stage when you are ready to make the
<code>gradelist</code> file, remove all but the current studentlist
file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="create-your-quizzes">Create your quizzes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-your-quizzes"></a>
</h2>
<p>To create quizzes, use the provided template. You can get the
template by clicking <code>Get quiz template</code>, or by manually
going into the <code>/templates</code> folder of your course.</p>
<p>For each quiz, you need to create a separate file based on the
template, they should all be structured as shown in the template.
<strong>The name of each quiz file needs to agree with the QuizID entry
and be <code>QuizID_complete.xlsx</code> (see next).</strong></p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="quiz-columns">Quiz Columns<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quiz-columns"></a>
</h3>
<p>Each quiz <strong>must have</strong> columns with the following names
and content. All column names need to be spelled as shown in the
template. Additional columns are optional and will be ignored.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="quizid">QuizID<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quizid"></a>
</h4>
<p>A unique ID. This can only contain letters, numbers and underscore.
Only the entry in the first row matters, anything else in further rows
is ignored. It cannot be empty. <strong>Quiz files need to have the name
<code>QuizID_complete.xlsx</code> where <code>QuizID</code> is the entry
in the column of that name.</strong> So if you set QuizID to
<code>firstquiz</code> then the file name needs to be
<code>firstquiz_complete.xlsx</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="questionid">QuestionID<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#questionid"></a>
</h4>
<p>A unique ID for each question. This can only contain letters, numbers
and underscore. It is best to give each question a unique ID across all
quizzes for easier question identification during analysis. I recommend
combining quiz ID with some additional question ID
(e.g. <code>quiz1q1</code>, <code>quiz1q2</code>, etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="question">Question<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#question"></a>
</h4>
<p>The question text. You can use basic formatting, e.g. line breaks and
such. Fancy formatting, e.g. equations or pictures or such are currently
not supported, and unlikely will be. If you need to provide additional
information, you can include a link to a URL into the question, or
reference other materials which can contain anything else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="instruction">Instruction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#instruction"></a>
</h4>
<p>Provide additional instructions to the students, e.g. instructions
regarding rounding, entering an integer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The columns just described will be part of the files that are
generated for the students. An empty <code>Answer</code> column is also
incuded. All other columns described next exist only in your complete
solution files and are not included in the files given to the
students.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="answer">Answer<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#answer"></a>
</h4>
<p>The correct answer to the question. Write it exactly the way you want
students to specify it. Make sure you don’t have accidental white spaces
after your answer. See below for more details on what kinds of answers
are implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="feedback">Feedback<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feedback"></a>
</h4>
<p>This is optional feedback that will be provided to the student if
their submission is found to not be correct. The feedback will not be
shown for correct entries. Students will see the feedback after they
submit their quiz, together with the
<code>Correct</code>/<code>Not Correct</code> label. If you want to
allow for more than one submission attempt, you should probably not
provide the answer outright here. If there is only one submission and
you want students to see the correct answers right away, you can copy
the answers into this column.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="type">Type<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#type"></a>
</h4>
<p>Type of question/answer. Several types are currently allowed.
Depending on the type, answers are evaluated differently, as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Character:</strong> A single character is expected and only
the first character is evaluated. Capitalization is ignored. This means
if the answer is <code>A</code> and the student provides <code>A)</code>
or anything that starts with either <code>A</code> or <code>a</code> it
will be marked as <code>correct</code>, otherwise
<code>not correct</code>. Good for multiple choice.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Matches text provided by student with answer
text. Leading and trailing white spaces are trimmed in the submission
and capitalization is ignored, but otherwise matching is strict. Thus,
if the answer is <code>hello world</code> and the student submits
<code>hello  world</code> (extra white space), it would be marked as
<code>not correct</code>. So use this type of question/answer with care,
as it is easy for there to be a non-match based on benign reasons,
e.g. a simple typo. Probably best for single words.</p>
<p><strong>Logical:</strong> The student is expected to write either
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. Also allowed are
<code>Yes</code> and <code>No</code> and <code>1</code> and
<code>0</code>. Only the first character is evaluated and capitalization
is ignored. Thus, if a student enters anything starting with
<code>t</code>, <code>y</code> or <code>1</code> it will be interpreted
to mean <code>TRUE</code>. Similarly, <code>f</code>, <code>n</code> and
<code>0</code> are evaluated to mean <code>FALSE</code>. Anything else
is automatically interpreted as an incorrect submission and labeled as
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Integer:</strong> Whatever the student provides is rounded to
the nearest integer, then compared with the answer. So if the answer is
42 and the student provides 41.5 or 42.4, that’s evaluated as correct,
41.4 would be evaluated as wrong. So would <code>41</code> or
<code>43</code>. Any submitted answer that can’t be converted to numeric
is labeled as wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Fuzzy_Integer:</strong> Similar to <code>Integer</code>,
whatever the student provides is rounded to the nearest integer, then
compared with the answer. The difference is that this type also allows
for a plus/minus 1 difference. This is done in case students don’t know
how to round and you don’t want to penalize them for that. So if the
answer is 42 and the non-rounded answer the student gets is 41.5 and
they round it - wrongly - to 41, it would still be considered correct.
Any submitted answer that can’t be converted to numeric is labeled as
wrong.</p>
<p><em>When to use <code>Fuzzy_Integer</code> or
<code>Integer</code>:</em> If you know the answer is an integer, e.g. if
the question is <em>“How many US states are there”</em> and the right
answer is 50, you don’t want to allow 49 or 51 to be considered correct,
so you should use the <code>Integer</code> type. If on the other hand
you ask students to do some calculation and the result is 41.50123 and
you want them to round it to an integer, if you want to be strict and
only allow proper rounding (i.e. 42) you should use <code>Integer</code>
type, if you do not want to penalize rounding mistakes, you should use
<code>Fuzzy_Integer</code> which would also accept 41 as correct. A
submission of 40.567 would also be considered correct, since the number
is first rounded to an integer, then checked if it is within plus/minus
1 of the correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>Numeric:</strong> An exact numeric value. Submission is
directly compared to answer, an exact match expected. This means if the
answer is 42.34 and a student submits 42.343, it is labeled as wrong.
Any submitted answer that can’t be converted to numeric is labeled as
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Rounded_Numeric:</strong> A numeric value rounded to some
specified significant digits. Those digits need to match the provided
answer. Thus if the answer is 42.42, you should specify that students
need to round to 2 significant digits. This again allows for non-proper
rounding, e.g. if a student gets 42.4163 and mistakenly rounds to 42.41
it will still be considered as correct. If you don’t want that and want
to be strict, use the <code>Numeric</code> type.</p>
<p><em>A note on answer types: I implemented those that I use for my own
teaching. If you have others that you want/need, please let me know.
Most of them should not be too hard to implement and I’d be happy to do
so (if reasonably easy to do).</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="comment">Comment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comment"></a>
</h4>
<p>These are any notes/comments you want to add for yourself. Students
will never see those.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="duedate">DueDate<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#duedate"></a>
</h4>
<p>A date on which the quiz is due. Only the entry in the first row
matters, anything else in further rows is ignored. It cannot be empty.
It should be coded as a text (don’t allow Excel to transform it into a
date). It needs to follow the ISO standard, i.e. be of the form
YEAR-MO-DA (e.g. 2021-05-22). Times are currently not implemented, thus
students have until midnight of the due date to submit. If you very much
want/need a due time, let me know and I can implement that. If you want
to have a quiz that has no due date, just set a due date very far into
the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="attempts">Attempts<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#attempts"></a>
</h4>
<p>Number of submission attempts students can make. Only the entry in
the first row matters, anything else in further rows is ignored. It
needs to be a positive integer. Note that currently, any new submission
will overwrite previous ones (which means if a student submits twice and
the second attempt is worse, that lower score will be recorded). If you
need unlimited submission attempts, set this to a very large number.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="notes-for-quiz-creation">Notes for quiz creation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#notes-for-quiz-creation"></a>
</h3>
<p>I assume you’ll be making your quiz sheets using Excel or similar
(e.g. LibreOffice). These programs are sometimes overly eager when it
comes to formatting. The safest approach is to format all cells as text.
When these quiz sheets are read in, each cell is read as text and then
internally converted (to e.g. a date or a numeric value). If you allow
the spreadsheet software to do formatting, things might go wrong
(e.g. if you read in a date format from Excel as text, it often shows up
wrong). Always test your quizzes before giving them to students.</p>
<p>Also note that both <strong>Duedate</strong> and
<strong>Attempts</strong> columns are not copied over to the student
sheets. Instead, I assume that you will provide this information to
students in some other way, e.g., when they receive their copies of the
quiz files to be filled, or posted somewhere in your syllabus or other
course materials.</p>

<p>Once you created your quizzes, you need to place them into the
<code>completequizzes</code> folder. To do so, use the
<code>Add completed quiz to course</code> button in UI. You need to add
one quiz at a time. The quiz will be checked for proper content and a
file with the name of the QuizID, appended by <code>_complete</code>
will be placed in the <code>completequizzes</code> folder.</p>
<p>You can also add completed quizzes manually to the
<code>completequizzes</code> folder. If you do so, files are not checked
for correctness. They will be checked during creation of student sheets
and the grade sheet. You also need to ensure the files have the right
names. <strong>Complete quiz files need to be named
<code>QuizID_complete.xlsx</code> where <code>QuizID</code> is the entry
in the column of that name inside the quiz sheet.</strong></p>

<p>If you want to make changes to any quiz, just edit, then re-upload
through the UI. It will overwrite any previous quiz of the same name.
Alternatively, you can skip the UI and directly edit the Excel files in
the <code>completequizzes</code> folder.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="remove-quizzes">Remove quizzes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#remove-quizzes"></a>

<p><strong>Currently not working through UI.</strong></p>
<p>You can remove quizzes (or other files) that you don’t want in the
<code>completequizzes</code> folder by using the
<code>Remove quiz</code> button in the UI. Alternatively, just go into
the <code>complete_quizzes</code> folder and delete unwanted files.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="creating-student-quiz-sheets">Creating student quiz sheets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-student-quiz-sheets"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once you are done creating quizzes, you should have a collection of
properly formatted Excel files in the <code>completequizzes</code>
folder. Remove any files from that folder that are not quizzes you want
to use. All your quizzes need to follow the naming convention as
described previously. To create quiz sheets that will be given to
students, click the <code>Create student quiz files</code> button in the
GUI, or run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/create_studentquizzes.html">create_studentquizzes</a></span><span class="op">(</span>courselocation <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"path/to/location/for/course"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This checks each quiz file in the <code>completequizzes</code> folder
for proper formatting and content, and if successful, generates a
matching sheet to be given to students. The student sheets will contain
the columns <code>QuizID</code>, <code>QuestionID</code>,
<code>Question</code>, <code>Instruction</code> and an empty
<code>Answer</code> column. The remaining columns will not be included
in the student sheets.</p>
<p>You can find all the student quiz files in the
<code>studentquizzes</code> folder. There is also a zip file that
includes all quizzes. You can get this file by clicking the
<code>Get zip file with all student quizzes</code> button in the UI (or
as always by going directly into the <code>studentquizzes</code>
folder.)</p>
<p>Distribute these files to the students by any means you like
(e.g. email, Dropbox, posting to a course website, etc.). Students will
fill out the quiz sheets by entering their answers into the
<code>Answer</code> column, and then submit them through the online
submission app.</p>
<p>If you update/edit/add quizzes, make sure all updated files are in
the <code>completequizzes</code> folder, then re-generate the student
quizzes and re-distribute.</p>
<p><strong>Note that during the process of student quiz creation, the
<code>studentquizzes</code> folder and all its content are deleted and
newly created - so don’t store anything in there!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="creating-the-main-grade-tracking-document">Creating the main grade tracking document<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-the-main-grade-tracking-document"></a>
</h2>
<p>At this stage, you should have a filled student list in the
<code>studentlists</code> folder and have all your quizzes done and
stored in <code>completequizzes</code> (and generated equivalent student
quiz sheets). I recommend only having your most current student list
file in the <code>studentlists</code> folder and only the quizzes you
want to use in the <code>completequizzes</code> folder.</p>
<p>In this step, you will generate the main file that will track all
student grades. This will merge information from the student list and
all quiz sheets. To generate this main tracking file, click the
<code>Create grade tracking list</code> button or run this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">create_gradelist</span><span class="op">(</span>courselocation <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"path/to/location/for/course"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you use the UI, this will also run the student quiz generation
routine to ensure everything is in sync. If you don’t use the UI, make
sure that your student quiz files match the current version of the
quizzes.</p>
<p>Both the student list and each quiz will be checked for proper
formatting/content. Fix any errors you might get. If everything works,
the grade tracking list will be placed into the <code>gradelists</code>
folder. It will have the name
<code>DATETIME_gradelist_COURSENAME</code>. Note that the quizzes are
ordered in this tracking document based on their file names and not
their due dates. If you want to have the quizzes show up in the order in
which they are given in class (because you might want to manually look
into the grade tracking sheet), you need to make sure the file names of
the quizzes follow the order of the due dates.</p>
<p>If the student roster changes, or if you modify/add quizzes,
<strong>before</strong> students have started to submit quiz solutions,
you can always re-create a new tracking document. Once students have
started submitting quizzes, things get trickier. Managing changes to
class list or quizzes in that setting is explained in a later
tutorial.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="using-the-grading-system">Using the grading system<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-grading-system"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once you created the class list and all quizzes, produced quiz sheets
for students and generated the main grade tracking document, you are
ready to deploy the student-facing part of the quiz system. Those steps
involve:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Provide students with the quiz files they need to fill
out.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide students with any additional information they need for
the quizzes (deadlines, allowed submission attempts, website for
submission, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy the grading app to a Shiny server and tell the students
where to go to submit their completed quizzes.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the grading app is fully deployed, it works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students fill out the quiz sheets, the go to the URL where your
app lives, enter their information and upload their quiz.</p></li>
<li><p>The online system grades the submission by checking it against
the solution. It provides immediate feedback to students on how they
did, and records the grade in the main tracking sheet. All student
submitted files are saved in the <code>studentsubmissions</code> folder,
which allows for detailed analytics and provides a complete track record
of any submission (in case something goes wrong in the main grade
tracking file).</p></li>
<li><p>You occasionally retrieve the grade tracking sheet and the
student submissions from the server and use the
<code>Analyze Quizzes</code> tab in the UI (or equivalent functions on
the command line) to see how students are doing, and to check which
questions are problematic and indicate students didn’t fully understand
that content (or you wrote a bad question).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#next-steps"></a>
</h2>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 above are self-explanatory. The app deployment requires
more information. You have 3 main options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="./C_hosting_on_own_shiny_server.html">Deploy to a Shiny
server that you have control over</a></li>
<li><a href="./D_hosting_on_shinyappsio.html">Deploy to
shinyapps.io</a></li>
<li><a href="">Keep things local</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of those approaches are described in the different
tutorials.</p>
<!-- There are also a tutorials [explaining how to analyze quizzes]() and [how to update quizzes or the class list once students have started submitting](). -->
